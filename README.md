# DuplicateResearch

DuplicateResearch is a simple application used to search for duplicate files and folders on your hard drive.
The program analyzes the folder indicated by the user in terms of the presence of duplicates based on the MD5 shortcut.
The result of the work is presented through the interactive SunburstJ chart and in the form of a table.
The user can choose and delete duplicate files.

The application was written in Java using the JavaFX framework.
The Model-View-Controller pattern was used for its design.
When presenting the data on the chart, the decorator design pattern was used.
